## Async / Off-Policy Training

`prime-rl` is asynchronous by default. The trainer and inference always run one step overlapped: while the trainer is producing $\pi_n$ from rollouts at step $n$, inference is already generating the rollouts for step $n+1$ using $\pi_{n-1}$. With matched trainer and inference step times this produces fully-overlapped pipeline parallelism — neither side ever idles.

![Async pipeline: trainer step n produces $\theta_n$, inference at step n samples with $\theta_{n-1}$](assets/async-pipeline.png)

At step $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$:

- **Trainer** produces policy $\pi_n$ with weights $\theta_n$ from rollouts $(x_n, y_n)$.
- **Inference** produces rollouts $(x_n, y_n)$ from policy $\pi_{\max(0,\,n-1)}$.

Step indices are 0-indexed so the gap holds at startup — inference is exactly one step behind the trainer.

## Loss

### Default Loss

The default RL loss is a DPPO policy-gradient term combined with a KL regularizer similar to Kimi-K2.5. For each prompt $x_j$ we sample a group of $G$ rollouts $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^G$, score them to get $s_i$, then optimize:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\,\mathcal{J}_{\text{PG}}(\theta) \;+\; \tau_{KL}\,\mathcal{L}_{KL}(\theta)
$$

where the policy-gradient term is

$$
\mathcal{J}_{\text{PG}}(\theta)
= \frac{1}{\sum_{j,i} |y_i^{(j)}|}
\sum_{j,i,t}
\min\!\left(\frac{\pi(y_{i,t}^{(j)}\mid x_j, y_{i,<t}^{(j)})}{\mu(y_{i,t}^{(j)}\mid x_j, y_{i,<t}^{(j)})}, \delta\right) \hat{A}^{(j)}_{i,t}
$$

and the KL regularizer penalizes drift between trainer and inference policies via the squared log importance ratio:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{KL}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sum_{j,i} |y_i^{(j)}|}
\sum_{j,i,t} \log^2\!\left(\frac{\pi(y_{i,t}^{(j)}\mid x_j, y_{i,<t}^{(j)})}{\mu(y_{i,t}^{(j)}\mid x_j, y_{i,<t}^{(j)})}\right).
$$

$\mu$ is the policy that generated the rollout (inference), $\pi$ is the current policy (trainer), $\hat{A}_{i,t}$ is the token-level advantage, $\delta$ is the importance-sampling clipping ratio, and $\tau_{KL}$ is the KL temperature. The `min` clamps the importance ratio from above so a stale rollout assigning very low probability to a high-reward token doesn't produce a runaway gradient.

The knobs (under `[trainer.loss]` with `type = "default"`):

| Knob | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `dppo_mask_low` / `dppo_mask_high` | 0.2 / 0.2 | Lower / upper thresholds for DPPO-style token-level masking. |
| `adv_tau` | 1.0 | Temperature on the advantage term. Set to 0 for pure distillation (no RL signal). |
| `kl_tau` | 1e-3 | Temperature on the KL regularizer. Set to 0 to disable. |

The trainer dispatches automatically based on the batch's training mode (set by the orchestrator via `orchestrator.training_mode`):

- `rl` mode → DPPO + KL with the advantage signal.
- `opd` mode → KL distillation against the teacher's per-token logprobs. The teacher must be a vLLM server (it's the only one that exposes `prompt_logprobs`).
- `sft` mode → standard token-level NLL on teacher-generated rollouts.

Set `[trainer.loss] type = "default"` and configure via the knobs above. SFT and OPD modes ignore the policy-gradient–specific fields.

### Custom Loss

The loss is computed **per sequence**: you write a function that takes one sequence's tensors and returns a scalar loss. The trainer iterates and aggregates.

```python
# my_module.py
import torch
from prime_rl.trainer.rl.loss import LossInputs, LossOutputs

def ppo_clip_loss(inputs: LossInputs, clip_eps: float = 0.2) -> LossOutputs:
    ratio = torch.exp(inputs.trainer_logprobs - inputs.inference_logprobs)
    clipped = torch.clamp(ratio, 1 - clip_eps, 1 + clip_eps)
    surr1 = ratio * inputs.advantages
    surr2 = clipped * inputs.advantages
    loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2)[inputs.loss_mask].sum()
    return LossOutputs(
        loss=loss,
        metrics={
            "clip_frac": (ratio != clipped)[inputs.loss_mask].float().mean(),
        },
    )
```

Wire it up:

```toml
[trainer.loss]
type = "custom"
import_path = "my_module.ppo_clip_loss"
kwargs = { clip_eps = 0.2 }
```

The dataclasses:

```python
@dataclass
class LossInputs:
    trainer_logprobs: Float[Tensor, "seq"]      # current policy
    inference_logprobs: Float[Tensor, "seq"]    # rollout-time policy
    teacher_logprobs: Float[Tensor, "seq"] | None  # only set in OPD mode
    advantages: Float[Tensor, "seq"]
    loss_mask: Bool[Tensor, "seq"]

@dataclass
class LossOutputs:
    loss: Float[Tensor, ""]
    metrics: dict[str, Tensor]
```

Anything you put in `metrics` is averaged across sequences and logged with the other trainer metrics.

## Advantage

### Default Advantage

The default advantage is per-group reward minus per-group baseline (DR-GRPO without std normalization). For each prompt's group of `group_size` rollouts, every token in rollout $i$ receives advantage $s_i - \bar{s}$ where $\bar{s}$ is the group mean.

This is intentionally simple — it does the right thing for most envs. Switch to a [custom advantage](#custom-advantage) when you need group-aware shaping that depends on trajectory metadata (sub-agent rollouts, relative-rank shaping, …).

A **length penalty** can be layered on top of the default advantage to discourage rambling. Configured under `[orchestrator.advantage.length_penalty]`, it subtracts a `coef * pass_rate * (completion tokens / orchestrator.seq_len)` term from every reward before the baseline subtraction, where `pass_rate` is the problem's mean reward across the group. The pass-rate factor means problems the model already solves reliably get the strongest push toward concise outputs, while rarely-solved problems are barely penalized (a never-solved group, mean reward 0, gets none). Set `gate_by_correctness = true` to apply the penalty only to correct rollouts (`reward == 1`), leaving incorrect ones untouched:

```toml
[orchestrator.advantage.length_penalty]
coef = 0.25                 # effective penalty is coef * pass_rate * (completion_tokens / seq_len)
gate_by_correctness = false # when true, only penalize rollouts with reward == 1
```

By default the baseline is the plain group mean reward. Set `length_weighted_baseline = true` to instead use the token-length-weighted mean — `sum(len_i * reward_i) / sum(len_i)` — which centers advantages by per-token expected reward when rollouts vary a lot in length:

```toml
[orchestrator.advantage]
length_weighted_baseline = true
```


### Custom Advantage

Advantages are computed **per group**. You write a function that takes one group of rollouts and returns one advantage scalar per rollout. The orchestrator handles groups of varying size automatically — partial-group training kicks in when some rollouts in a group errored.

```python
# my_module.py
import statistics
from prime_rl.orchestrator.advantage import AdvantageInputs, AdvantageOutputs

def normalized_advantage(inputs: AdvantageInputs, eps: float = 1e-8) -> AdvantageOutputs:
    rewards = [r["reward"] for r in inputs.rollouts]
    mean = statistics.fmean(rewards)
    std = statistics.pstdev(rewards) if len(rewards) > 1 else 0.0
    return AdvantageOutputs(advantages=[(r - mean) / (std + eps) for r in rewards])
```

```toml
[orchestrator.advantage]
type = "custom"
import_path = "my_module.normalized_advantage"
kwargs = { eps = 1e-8 }
```

`AdvantageInputs.rollouts` is a list of `verifiers.RolloutOutput`, so you have access to the full rollout (turns, tool calls, custom metadata) — not just the reward. Use this for anything reward-shaping-like that needs trajectory context.

### Per-Env Advantage

`advantage` can be set per training environment. Each env inherits the top-level `[orchestrator.advantage]` when it doesn't set its own, so mixed-env runs can give each env its own advantage computation:

```toml
[orchestrator.advantage]
type = "default"  # the default every env inherits unless it overrides

[[orchestrator.train.env]]
id = "math-env"   # inherits the default above

[[orchestrator.train.env]]
id = "agent-env"
advantage = { type = "custom", import_path = "my_module.normalized_advantage" }
```

## Filters

Filters drop rollouts between scoring and training. Built-ins (composable):

| Filter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `gibberish` | Drops rollouts whose mean log-prob fall below a threshold — usually a sign of degenerate output. |
| `repetition` | Drops rollouts with high n-gram repetition. |
| `zero_advantage` | Drops rollouts whose advantage is zero, so the trainer doesn't waste tokens on them. |

The default `[orchestrator]` config already includes all three filters with their defaults. To override, set `filters` explicitly — the list replaces the defaults wholesale:

```toml
[[orchestrator.filters]]
type = "zero_advantage"

[[orchestrator.filters]]
type = "repetition"
threshold = 0.4
```

Filtered rollouts still appear in W&B distributions, just not in the trainer batch — useful for spotting whether filtering is doing its job.

Set `drop_context_limits_before_advantage = true` to discard context-limit rollouts before advantage calculation. It matches `context_length` / `prompt_too_long` / `max_input_tokens` and final response usage at `seq_len`; it does not drop timeouts or max-turn stops. The cumulative count of excluded context-limit rollouts, including ones already marked as rollout errors, is logged as `train_sink/context_limited_before_advantage_total`.

## Difficulty Pools

Difficulty pools gradually retire problems the model has solved or never solves. After each rollout, the average reward across a problem's group is compared to two thresholds:

- `buffer.easy_threshold` — at or above this, the problem moves into the `easy` pool and is no longer sampled.
- `buffer.hard_threshold` — at or below this, the problem moves into the `hard` pool and is no longer sampled.
- Otherwise the problem stays in `normal` and remains in the sampling rotation.

Pool assignments persist across checkpoints (`easy_examples.jsonl` / `hard_examples.jsonl` under each step's orchestrator checkpoint). When you resume — or want to broaden the curriculum mid-run — `buffer.easy_fraction` / `buffer.hard_fraction` randomly lift that fraction of pooled problems back into `normal` so they re-enter sampling.

```toml
[orchestrator.buffer]
easy_threshold = 0.95
hard_threshold = 0.05
easy_fraction = 0.0   # default; bump on resume to bring some easy problems back
hard_fraction = 0.0   # default; bump on resume to bring some hard problems back
```

Watch `pool/{env}/{easy,normal,hard}` (current pool ratios) and `evicted_examples/{env}/{easy,hard}` (per-step eviction rate).

## Online Difficulty Filtering

Online difficulty filtering (ODF) drops collapsed-advantage groups on the way *into* the buffer. Set `buffer.online_difficulty_filtering = true` (default `false`) to enable:

- Average reward across the group is **0.0** (every rollout failed) → drop the group, count under `filtered_rollouts/{env}/hard`.
- Average reward **1.0** (every rollout succeeded) → drop, count under `filtered_rollouts/{env}/easy`.
- Otherwise → into the buffer.

These are exactly the groups whose within-group advantage collapses to zero — DR-GRPO produces no gradient signal for them, so the trainer would burn step time on tokens it can't learn from.

```toml
[orchestrator.buffer]
online_difficulty_filtering = true
```

**Tradeoff: trainer stability vs. inference speed.** With ODF on, every rollout that reaches the trainer carries non-zero advantage — each trainer step's effective batch is predictable and the gradient signal is denser. The cost is paid on the inference side: rollouts get produced and then thrown away, so the orchestrator has to oversample to keep the trainer fed. If the orchestrator is your bottleneck (`time/wait_for_batch` high on the trainer), ODF can starve the loop. Bump `orchestrator.oversampling_factor` so inference produces enough groups per step to absorb the drops.

ODF is orthogonal to the [pools](#difficulty-pools): ODF reacts to the *current* group's reward distribution, the pools track the *running* per-problem average. Many configs use both — ODF for per-step density, pools for long-horizon curriculum cleanup.

## Multi-Turn Trajectories

Multi-turn rollouts (tool use, browser environments, long conversations) used to be stitched into a single fake "single-turn" sample, which silently corrupted the importance ratio when chat templates didn't roundtrip. Since [`verifiers` v0.1.8](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers/releases/tag/v0.1.8), `prime-rl` records each LLM request/response as an independent **trajectory step** and merges them at training time using best-effort interleaving — with [renderers](#renderers) as the mechanism that keeps the merge safe by construction.

### Extension Property

A sequence of trajectory steps has the **extension property** when each successive step's prompt contains all previous prompts and completions as an exact prefix. The trainer relies on this property — when it holds:

- Multiple steps merge into one training sample.
- Compute scales as $O(T)$ in the trajectory length.

When it breaks (chat template strips past thinking, environment compacts context, an agent hands off to a sub-agent, etc.), the trainer starts a new training sample from that step:

- Graceful fallback to multiple samples — no corrupted data.
- Worst case (every step breaks extension) is $O(T^2)$.

### Best-Effort Interleaving

Concretely:

```
5-step trajectory where extension breaks at step 4:

steps 1–3: extension holds   → merged into Sample 1
step 4:    extension breaks  (e.g. thinking stripped from history)
steps 4–5: extension holds   → merged into Sample 2

result: 2 training samples instead of 5
```

The orchestrator enforces an **exact prefix invariant**: the prompt at turn $t$ must be the exact concatenation of prior messages exactly as the LLM originally generated them. If turn 2's prompt is `U1, A1', U2` while `A1' ≠ A1`, the orchestrator can't safely merge — either choice produces logprob drift between trainer and inference. Starting a fresh sample is the only correct behavior, so that's what happens.

### Renderers

Best-effort interleaving works because the renderer guarantees the exact-prefix invariant *by construction* — it never re-renders prior turns, so it can't lose tokens to chat-template normalization, BPE retokenization drift, or thinking stripping. A renderer turns a model's chat template into a Python object that can:

- `render_ids(messages)` — tokenize messages to ids the inference engine accepts.
- `parse_response(completion_ids)` — recover structured `(content, reasoning_content, tool_calls)` from sampled ids.
- `bridge_to_next_turn(prev_prompt_ids, prev_completion_ids, new_messages)` — extend the previous turn's tokens verbatim with the new environment turn, instead of re-rendering history.

When `bridge_to_next_turn` succeeds, the trainer sees the exact token stream the sampler produced; when it can't be proven safe (e.g. the renderer is `DefaultRenderer` and the template's stop sequence is unknown), it returns `None` and the orchestrator falls back to a full re-render — which triggers the new-sample fallback above.

A common source of breakage in the absence of a hand-coded renderer is models like Qwen3 whose chat templates strip past `<think>` blocks across user turns:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B")
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "U1"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>R1</think>A1"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "U2"},
]
tok.apply_chat_template(messages[:1], tokenize=False)
# <|im_start|>user
# U1<|im_end|>

tok.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False)
# <|im_start|>user\nU1<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA1<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nU2<|im_end|>
# (the <think>R1</think> from turn 2 is gone)
```

Hand-coded renderers ship for `qwen3`, `qwen3-vl`, `qwen3.5`, `glm5`, `glm4.5`, `minimax-m2`, `deepseek-v3`, `kimi-k2`, `kimi-k2.5`, `nemotron-3`, `gpt-oss`; anything else falls back to `DefaultRenderer` (a generic `apply_chat_template` wrapper). Pick one via:

```toml
[orchestrator.renderer]
name = "auto"   # detect from tokenizer; pass an explicit name for fine-tunes
```

For the full design rationale (failure modes ruled out, empirical token-identity comparison against `apply_chat_template`, when to write a hand-coded renderer), see [the renderers writeup on the Prime Intellect blog](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/renderers) — the canonical reference.

### Discontinuous Trajectories

Some envs are discontinuous by design — e.g. a main agent delegating to a sub-agent and getting back only a summarized result, not the sub-agent's whole conversation. Best-effort interleaving handles this naturally: each agent's contiguous turns merge, the handoff starts a new sample. The trainer never sees fabricated extension where there is none.
