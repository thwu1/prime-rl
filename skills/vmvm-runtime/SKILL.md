# VMVM runtime

The first-class provider is `verifiers.v1.runtimes.VMVMRuntime`. It follows the
same `Runtime` contract as Modal: provision, run foreground/background commands,
read/write bytes, reach the host interception server, and release the sandbox.
The implementation uses `vmvm_tb_v2` only for vacli lease, SSH, and Podman
operations.

Select it in an eval TOML:

```toml
[harness.runtime]
type = "vmvm"
session_timeout = 2100
tenant_id = "async_2347641"
lease_ttl = "60s"
```

The local backend package must be importable by the CPU evaluator:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/environments/vmvm_tb_v2${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"
```

Do not run VMVM evaluation drivers on a login node. Validate the real provider
contract with:

```bash
sbatch user/tianhaowu/deepswe_vmvm/run_runtime_smoke.sbatch
```

The smoke checks a real lease, binary file round trip, workdir execution, the
container-to-host interception route, and cleanup. The host route is an SSH
reverse forward on VM loopback plus a VM bridge relay; the container URL must
bypass its HTTP proxy through `NO_PROXY`.

Pier's DeepSWE adapter supports prebuilt agent images and the benchmark's
separate verifier Dockerfiles. It validates the Dockerfile, starts its `FROM`
image, copies the hidden verifier files only into the verifier runtime, and
executes its `RUN` steps. Non-agent commands clear inherited proxy variables so
test behavior matches the no-network verifier contract.
Commands use a non-login shell, matching Pier's Modal executor. A login shell can
replace the image `PATH` and hide tools installed in an image virtual environment
such as `/opt/venv/bin`.

Validate one reference solution before the full oracle:

```bash
sbatch user/tianhaowu/deepswe_modal/submit_oracle.sbatch vmvm \
  --n-concurrent 1 --n-tasks 1 --sample-seed 0 \
  --sandbox-timeout-sec 14400 --verifier-timeout-multiplier 4 \
  --name deepswe-v1.1-oracle-smoke
```

`--task-name` takes the task directory name, not the namespaced result name. For
example, target the memory-heavy SCC gate with:

```bash
sbatch user/tianhaowu/deepswe_modal/submit_oracle.sbatch vmvm \
  --n-concurrent 1 --task-name scc-bounded-memory-spilling \
  --name deepswe-v1.1-oracle-scc
```

Task CPU and memory declarations are enforced on the Podman container. The
current VMVM tenant supplies about 4 GB of physical RAM, so requests above that
are backed by a per-lease swapfile on the VM's dedicated XFS container-storage
disk. The VM root and `/var/tmp` are overlayfs and cannot host swapfiles; using
them fails with `swapon: Invalid argument`. Keep 512 MiB outside the requested
container memory for VM services. A Go verifier ending in `signal: killed`
usually means this host-memory setup did not take effect.

Never replay an agent command after an uncertain transport result. A nonnegative
exit code is the command result; a negative exit code is surfaced as
`SandboxError`, allowing rollout-level retry policy to decide whether to start a
fresh attempt. Cleanup remains idempotent and closes every active bridge before
releasing the vacli lease.

VMVM interception does not create a Prime sandbox or require Prime tunnel
credentials. Arbitrary public port exposure from a VMVM container is not yet a
supported provider capability; colocated servers and the harness interception
path do not need it.

DeepSWE model traffic does not use a Modal relay or VMVM's per-sandbox host
tunnel. The CPU eval driver registers its authenticated capture proxy with the
shared `ram-inference-gateway`, and the MiniSWE process in each VMVM calls that
stable public ingress. VMVM's reverse-SSH `host_endpoint` remains available for
generic Runtime consumers and its contract smoke.

`VACLI_IMAGE_PULL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` bounds each VM-side image pull attempt. The
DeepSWE launcher derives it from TOML `sandbox_startup_timeout_sec` and uses one
hour by default; keep the command/session ceiling separate because verification
can legitimately outlive startup.
Use `verifier_timeout_multiplier = 4.0` in full VMVM TOMLs and
`--verifier-timeout-multiplier 4` for the oracle. This retains the task's own
timeout ratios while allowing slow remote verifier execution to complete.
